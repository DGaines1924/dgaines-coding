Today I learned about f-strings in python. It's just like a
normal string, but you can put variables in the string to
add in other bits of info. It's similar to %d and %s in C
code.

Today I also learned a little about the textwrap class. It
has a lot to do with text formatting in the I/O realm and it
pretty helpful for when there are a lot of strings. I only
reallyknow a little bit about this class, but i'll learn
more over time

I just found out that the down arrow deletes everything i
type so my fat entry was deleted and I wasnt able to get it
back. So now imma paraphrase because im not typing all that
out again. So we have two big github command I will be using
a lot (all the time), "so in general, ill probably be using
git push instead of pull more often because i want to save
my code on the remote spot so i can access it on my laptop.
And on my laptop ill probably use git pull a loot because
ill be doing most of my work on my pc and am going to need
to also update the code on my laptop. Is my thinking correct
here?" The answer is yes, my logic is correct.

Ok, it took some time, but i got the pop up working again.
It was writing to the wrong folder for some reason, so i had
to manually tie it to write into the current script folder.
Im now going to make the file .pyw hopefully it doesnt mess
up anything.
