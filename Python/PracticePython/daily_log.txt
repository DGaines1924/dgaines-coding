Today I learned about f-strings in python. It's just like a
normal string, but you can put variables in the string to
add in other bits of info. It's similar to %d and %s in C
code.

Today I also learned a little about the textwrap class. It
has a lot to do with text formatting in the I/O realm and it
pretty helpful for when there are a lot of strings. I only
reallyknow a little bit about this class, but i'll learn
more over time
